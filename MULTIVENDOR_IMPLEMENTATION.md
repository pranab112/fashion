# Multi-Vendor Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document describes the multi-vendor functionality that has been added to the Django e-commerce project. The implementation allows brands to have their own vendor accounts and manage their products through the admin interface.

## Key Features

### 1. User Types
- **Customer**: Regular shoppers (default)
- **Vendor**: Brand owners who can sell products
- **Admin**: Site administrators

### 2. Vendor Capabilities
- Create and manage their own brands
- Add products under their brands
- View their orders and sales
- Manage shop settings (banner, policies, etc.)
- Track payouts and commissions

### 3. Brand Enhancement
Brands now include:
- Vendor ownership
- Verification status
- Custom commission rates
- Shop page with banner
- Business information
- Contact details
- Return policy
- Shipping information

### 4. Admin Interface
The admin interface has been enhanced with:
- Vendor-specific views (vendors only see their own data)
- Brand verification workflow
- Commission management
- Payout tracking
- Vendor order management

## Database Changes

### User Model Updates
```python
# Added to CustomUser model:
- user_type (customer/vendor/admin)
- is_vendor_approved (boolean)
- vendor_commission_rate (decimal)
```

### Brand Model Updates
```python
# Added to Brand model:
- vendor (ForeignKey to CustomUser)
- is_verified (boolean)
- commission_rate (decimal, optional)
- shop_banner (image)
- shop_description (text)
- return_policy (text)
- shipping_info (text)
- contact_email (email)
- contact_phone (char)
- business_name (char)
- tax_id (char)
```

### New Models
1. **VendorProfile**: Extended vendor information including bank details and statistics
2. **VendorPayout**: Track vendor payouts
3. **VendorOrder**: Track vendor-specific order information

## Migration Steps

To apply these changes to your database:

```bash
# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate users
python manage.py migrate products
```

## Admin Configuration

### Registering Vendor Admin
To use the vendor-enhanced admin, update your `products/admin.py`:

```python
# Replace the existing admin.py content with admin_vendor.py content
# Or import from admin_vendor.py
```

### Creating a Vendor User
1. Create a new user or edit existing user in admin
2. Set `user_type` to "Vendor"
3. Set `is_vendor_approved` to True
4. Optionally set a custom `vendor_commission_rate`

### Creating a Vendor Brand
1. Go to Brands in admin
2. Create a new brand
3. Assign it to a vendor user
4. Set `is_verified` to True to activate
5. Fill in shop details

## Frontend Integration (To Be Implemented)

### Brand Shop Pages
- URL: `/brands/<slug>/` - Brand shop page
- Display brand banner, description, and products
- Show vendor policies

### Vendor Dashboard
- URL: `/vendor/dashboard/` - Vendor management area
- Product management
- Order tracking
- Payout history
- Shop settings

## Commission System

### How It Works
1. Default commission rate: 10%
2. Vendor-specific rate can override default
3. Brand-specific rate can override vendor rate
4. Commission is calculated on order completion

### Commission Hierarchy
```
Brand commission_rate (if set)
  ↓ (fallback)
Vendor commission_rate (if set)
  ↓ (fallback)
Default rate (10%)
```

## Security Considerations

### Vendor Permissions
- Vendors can only manage their own brands
- Vendors can only see products from their brands
- Vendors cannot change featured status on products
- Vendors can only view their own orders

### Admin Controls
- Only admins can approve vendors
- Only admins can verify brands
- Only admins can process payouts
- Only admins can see all vendor data

## Next Steps

1. **Create Vendor Views**: Implement frontend views for vendor dashboard
2. **Payment Integration**: Connect payout system with payment gateway
3. **Email Notifications**: Add vendor-specific notifications
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Create vendor analytics views
5. **API Endpoints**: Add REST API for vendor operations

## Testing

To test the multi-vendor functionality:

1. Create a vendor user
2. Create a brand for the vendor
3. Add products to the brand
4. Place test orders
5. Check vendor order tracking
6. Verify commission calculations

## Notes

- The logout issue has been fixed by converting the logout link to a POST form
- Vendor models are in `products/vendor_models.py`
- Enhanced admin is in `products/admin_vendor.py`
- Migrations are ready to be applied
